# FSD Project Research Sheet

## Level 2

### Tesla Autopilot 2.0
Tesla Autopilot 2.0 is an upgrade to Tesla's semi-autonomous driving system introduced in late 2016. 
It uses an array of cameras, ultrasonic sensors, and radar to provide 360-degree visibility and facilitate features such as adaptive cruise control, lane centring, and automated lane changes. 
Autopilot 2.0 marked a significant step toward fully autonomous driving but requires constant driver supervision.

### Lane Keeping Assist (LKA)
Lane Keeping Assist is a technology found in many modern vehicles, including Tesla. 
It helps maintain the car within lane boundaries using cameras and sensors to detect lane markings. 
When the car drifts, the system gently steers it back to the centre of the lane.

## Level 3
### Audi A8's Traffic Jam Pilot
- **Functionality**:  
  Introduced with the 2019 Audi A8, Traffic Jam Pilot was designed to handle driving in slow-moving traffic at speeds up to 60 km/h (37 mph). It could manage acceleration, braking, and steering without driver input, allowing the driver to engage in other activities during operation.

- **Technological Components**:
    - Utilized **LIDAR** (a first in production vehicles at the time), front-facing cameras, radar, and ultrasonic sensors.
    - These components monitored the vehicle's surroundings to ensure safe operation.

- **Limitations and Legal Challenges**:
    - Faced significant regulatory hurdles. Legal frameworks in various regions were not prepared for **Level 3 autonomous driving** (where the system handles all aspects of driving in certain conditions without driver supervision).
    - Audi decided not to activate this feature in the A8 due to regulatory challenges.
    - In April 2020, Audi announced it would not offer Traffic Jam Pilot in the current generation of the A8.

### Tesla's Autopilot 3.0
- **Functionality**:  
  Tesla's Autopilot 3.0, part of the **Full Self-Driving (FSD)** suite, offers several advanced driving assistance features:
    - **Navigate on Autopilot**: Guides the vehicle from highway on-ramps to off-ramps, including lane changes and navigating interchanges.
    - Includes **automatic lane changes**, **traffic-aware cruise control**, and **Autosteer**.

- **System Behavior**:
    - The system takes full control under specific conditions (e.g., highway driving, traffic jams).
    - The driver can divert attention but must remain ready to intervene if prompted by the system.

- **Key Technologies**:
    - Uses cameras, radar, ultrasonic sensors, and Tesla's custom-built **Full Self-Driving Computer** for real-time processing and decision-making.
    - Tesla's **Over-the-Air Updates** continuously improve the system's capabilities.

### Summary
Both Audi's Traffic Jam Pilot and Tesla's Autopilot 3.0 represent **Level 3 autonomy**, where the system can manage driving under defined conditions. 
However, Audi's offering was hindered by regulatory challenges, leading to its deactivation, 
whereas Tesla continues to push advancements through its Autopilot and FSD features.

## Full Self Drive
### Waymo

**Overview**

Waymo, formerly the Google self-driving car project, is a leading developer of autonomous vehicle technology. 
Their mission is to make it safe and easy for people and things to move around without the need for a human driver.

**Technology**

Waymo's vehicles operate at Level 4 autonomy, meaning no human driver is needed within defined operational conditions. 
The system utilizes a combination of sensors, including:

- **Cameras**: 29 cameras mounted on the sides and top of the car to provide a 360-degree view.

- **Radar Sensors**: Six radar sensors track larger objects around the vehicle.

- **LiDAR Sensors**: Four LiDAR sensors use laser light to detect objects and measure distances accurately.

**Recent Developments**

Waymo has been expanding its autonomous ride-hailing service, Waymo One, in various cities. 
However, there have been instances highlighting challenges in the technology. 
For example, a tech entrepreneur experienced a malfunction where a Waymo vehicle began driving in circles, causing delays and raising concerns about reliability.

### Avride (Formerly Yandex Self-Driving Group)

**Overview**

Avride, previously known as Yandex Self-Driving Group, is a developer of autonomous vehicle technology and delivery robots. 
Originally part of the Russian company Yandex, the group rebranded as Avride and is now headquartered in Austin, Texas.

**Technology**

Avride's self-driving cars are equipped with a hardware and software system that includes:

- **Cameras**: For visual recognition and navigation.

- **LiDAR**: Light detection and ranging sensors to map the environment.

- **Radar**: To detect larger objects and assist in navigation.

**Recent Developments**

In October 2024, Uber partnered with Avride to offer autonomous vehicle rides and delivery services. 
This multiyear agreement marks an expansion of Uber's autonomous vehicle partnerships. 
Austin-based Uber customers will start seeing Uber Eats deliveries from Avride's six-wheeled sidewalk robots, with plans to extend to other cities. 
In 2025, selected Uber users in Dallas will be able to ride in Avride's autonomous vehicles.

**Testing and Mileage**

As of May 2021, the Yandex Self-Driving Group had driven seven million autonomous miles since its inception in 2017, demonstrating significant progress in the field.

### Conclusion

Both Waymo and Avride are at the forefront of developing full self-driving systems, contributing to the advancement of autonomous vehicle technology. 
While they have made significant strides, recent incidents highlight the ongoing challenges and the need for continuous improvement to ensure safety and reliability in real-world applications.
