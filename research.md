## Level 2

### Tesla Autopilot 2.0
Tesla Autopilot 2.0 is an upgrade to Tesla's semi-autonomous driving system introduced in late 2016. 
It uses an array of cameras, ultrasonic sensors, and radar to provide 360-degree visibility and facilitate features such as adaptive cruise control, lane centring, and automated lane changes. 
Autopilot 2.0 marked a significant step toward fully autonomous driving but requires constant driver supervision.

### Lane Keeping Assist (LKA)
Lane Keeping Assist is a technology found in many modern vehicles, including Tesla. 
It helps maintain the car within lane boundaries using cameras and sensors to detect lane markings. 
When the car drifts, the system gently steers it back to the centre of the lane.

## Level 3
### Audi A8's Traffic Jam Pilot
- **Functionality**:  
  Introduced with the 2019 Audi A8, Traffic Jam Pilot was designed to handle driving in slow-moving traffic at speeds up to 60 km/h (37 mph). It could manage acceleration, braking, and steering without driver input, allowing the driver to engage in other activities during operation.

- **Technological Components**:
    - Utilized **LIDAR** (a first in production vehicles at the time), front-facing cameras, radar, and ultrasonic sensors.
    - These components monitored the vehicle's surroundings to ensure safe operation.

- **Limitations and Legal Challenges**:
    - Faced significant regulatory hurdles. Legal frameworks in various regions were not prepared for **Level 3 autonomous driving** (where the system handles all aspects of driving in certain conditions without driver supervision).
    - Audi decided not to activate this feature in the A8 due to regulatory challenges.
    - In April 2020, Audi announced it would not offer Traffic Jam Pilot in the current generation of the A8.

### Tesla's Autopilot 3.0
- **Functionality**:  
  Tesla's Autopilot 3.0, part of the **Full Self-Driving (FSD)** suite, offers several advanced driving assistance features:
    - **Navigate on Autopilot**: Guides the vehicle from highway on-ramps to off-ramps, including lane changes and navigating interchanges.
    - Includes **automatic lane changes**, **traffic-aware cruise control**, and **Autosteer**.

- **System Behavior**:
    - The system takes full control under specific conditions (e.g., highway driving, traffic jams).
    - The driver can divert attention but must remain ready to intervene if prompted by the system.

- **Key Technologies**:
    - Uses cameras, radar, ultrasonic sensors, and Tesla's custom-built **Full Self-Driving Computer** for real-time processing and decision-making.
    - Tesla's **Over-the-Air Updates** continuously improve the system's capabilities.

### Summary
Both Audi's Traffic Jam Pilot and Tesla's Autopilot 3.0 represent **Level 3 autonomy**, where the system can manage driving under defined conditions. 
However, Audi's offering was hindered by regulatory challenges, leading to its deactivation, 
whereas Tesla continues to push advancements through its Autopilot and FSD features.
