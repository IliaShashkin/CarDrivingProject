### Tesla Autopilot 2.0
Tesla Autopilot 2.0 is an upgrade to Tesla's semi-autonomous driving system introduced in late 2016. 
It uses an array of cameras, ultrasonic sensors, and radar to provide 360-degree visibility and facilitate features such as adaptive cruise control, lane centring, and automated lane changes. 
Autopilot 2.0 marked a significant step toward fully autonomous driving but requires constant driver supervision.

### Lane Keeping Assist (LKA)
Lane Keeping Assist is a technology found in many modern vehicles, including Tesla. 
It helps maintain the car within lane boundaries using cameras and sensors to detect lane markings. 
When the car drifts, the system gently steers it back to the centre of the lane.
