  <h2>Audi's Traffic Jam Pilot</h2>
  <p>
      Audi introduced its Traffic Jam Pilot for the 2019 Audi A8 car <br>
      and the car is designed to handle slow-moving traffic at speeds up to
      60 km/h.<br> It can drive the car without the need of driver input
      and allows the driver to focus on other activities.
  </p>
        <p>The Audi Traffic Jam Pilot is one of the most advanced driver-assistance systems developed by Audi and represents Level 3 autonomy under the SAE's autonomous driving levels. This means that the system can perform driving tasks under certain conditions without driver intervention, but the driver must be ready to take control when requested.</p>

        <h3>LiDAR Integration:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Audi was the first automaker to use LiDAR for production vehicles. This sensor provides enhanced accuracy for detecting objects and mapping the road, especially in low-visibility conditions like rain or fog.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Core Features of Audi Traffic Jam Pilot:</h2>
        <br>

        <h3>Hands-Off Driving in Traffic:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>The system allows the driver to remove their hands from the wheel in specific low-speed traffic scenarios (up to 60 km/h or 37 mph) on divided highways with clear lane markings and no cross-traffic.</li>
            <li>The Traffic Jam Pilot manages acceleration, braking, steering, and lane-keeping without driver input.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Situational Awareness:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Traffic Jam Pilot constantly monitors its environment using a combination of cameras, radar sensors, ultrasonic sensors, and a LiDAR scanner.</li>
            <li>The LiDAR scanner is a key feature distinguishing Audi’s system from Tesla Autopilot (at the time of release), providing precise 3D mapping of the car’s surroundings for high reliability.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Conditions for Activation:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Works only in stop-and-go traffic or heavy congestion.</li>
            <li>Operates at speeds below 60 km/h (37 mph).</li>
            <li>Only on highways with a physical divider (no oncoming traffic).</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Driver Monitoring System:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>The system includes a driver monitoring camera to ensure the driver is ready to take back control if needed.</li>
            <li>If the driver is inattentive for too long and fails to respond to takeover requests, the car will initiate a safe stop by decelerating in its lane with hazard lights.</li>
        </ul>


        <h3>Traffic Sign and Hazard Recognition:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>The system detects traffic signs, construction zones, and changes in lane configurations, helping it adapt dynamically to its environment.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Switch to Manual Mode:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>In situations outside its operational design domain (e.g., higher speeds or non-divided roads), the system alerts the driver to take control.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <h5 class="caption">The system indicates that the Traffic Jam Pilot is ready to be activated. This feature is designed for highly automated driving in congested traffic at low speeds, such as stop-and-go situations on highways.
        Once activated, the system can control the car's speed, steering, and distance from other vehicles, allowing the driver to relax under specific conditions. The green lane markings on both sides indicate that the system is actively detecting lane boundaries and is prepared to keep the car centered within the lane.
        The green triangular arrows on the sides signify that the system is managing the lane position effectively.</h5>
    <h3>Challenges and Limitations</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>This feature has faced alot of legal setbacks(e.g. not having
        the framework in certain regions)</li>
        <li>Audi has discontinued the feature only for new car models</li>
    </ul>
