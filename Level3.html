  <h2>Audi's Traffic Jam Pilot</h2>
  <p>
      Audi introduced its Traffic Jam Pilot for the 2019 Audi A8 car <br>
      and the car is designed to handle slow-moving traffic at speeds up to
      60 km/h.<br> It can drive the car without the need of driver input
      and allows the driver to focus on other activities.
  </p>
    <h3>How does it work?</h3>
    <p>
        The traffic jam pilot uses <b>LIDAR</b> (Light Detection and Ranging)
        via the sensors on the car to determine the location of the vehicle
        and calculate what actions to take.<br>
