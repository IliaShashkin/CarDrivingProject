  <h2>Audi's Traffic Jam Pilot</h2>
  <p>
      Audi introduced its Traffic Jam Pilot for the 2019 Audi A8 car <br>
      and the car is designed to handle slow-moving traffic at speeds up to
      60 km/h.<br> It can drive the car without the need of driver input
      and allows the driver to focus on other activities.
  </p>
    <h3>How does it work?</h3>
    <p>
        The traffic jam pilot uses <b>LIDAR</b> (Light Detection and Ranging)
        via the sensors on the car (<a href="#traffic-jam-pilot" >as seen here</a>) to determine the location of the vehicle
        and calculate what actions to take.<br>

    <h5 class="caption">The system indicates that the Traffic Jam Pilot is ready to be activated. This feature is designed for highly automated driving in congested traffic at low speeds, such as stop-and-go situations on highways.
        Once activated, the system can control the car's speed, steering, and distance from other vehicles, allowing the driver to relax under specific conditions. The green lane markings on both sides indicate that the system is actively detecting lane boundaries and is prepared to keep the car centered within the lane.
        The green triangular arrows on the sides signify that the system is managing the lane position effectively.</h5>
    <h3>Challenges and Limitations</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>This feature has faced alot of legal setbacks(e.g. not having
        the framework in certain regions</li>
