        <h2>Waymo's Core Technologies</h2>
        <p>Waymo’s autonomous driving technology relies on several cutting-edge systems that work together to make safe, efficient, and reliable driving decisions. These technologies include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging):</strong> Waymo uses four LiDAR to create detailed 360-degree maps of its surroundings, helping the vehicle detect obstacles even in low-light conditions.</li>
            <li><strong>Radar:</strong> Six radar sensors provide longer-range object detection, helping the vehicle spot obstacles like other vehicles in poor visibility conditions.</li>
            <li><strong>Cameras:</strong> 29 High-definition cameras allow the vehicle to see traffic signals, pedestrians, and other key elements in its environment.</li>
            <li><strong>Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning:</strong> AI algorithms process data in real time, enabling the vehicle to make driving decisions and adapt to its environment.</li>
            <li><strong>High-Definition Maps:</strong> Waymo’s HD maps give the vehicle an accurate understanding of the road and help anticipate upcoming turns and intersections.</li>
            <li><strong>Safety Protocols & Redundancy Systems:</strong> Built-in redundancy ensures that critical systems, like braking, have backups in case of failure, maintaining safety for passengers and others on the road.</li>
            <li><strong>Sensor Fusion:</strong> Data from LiDAR, radar, cameras, and other sensors are combined to create a unified, accurate view of the environment, helping the vehicle make more reliable decisions.</li>
        </ul>

<div class="content">
    <div class="section">
    <h3>Operations and Testing</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Testing:</strong> The self-driving cars underwent extensive testing on public roads in Russia, accumulating millions of miles. The tests included urban roads, highways, and a variety of weather conditions typical for Russia.</li>
        <li><strong>Collaboration:</strong> The Yandex Self-Driving Group was closely involved in the Russian ride-hailing market, working with Yandex.Taxi to implement autonomous vehicles in its fleet.</li>
    </ul>
<br>
        <h3>V2X (Vehicle-to-Everything) – Communication with Infrastructure</h3>
        <p>Yandex autonomous vehicles may exchange data with other FSD-cars, traffic lights, and road infrastructure, enabling real-time traffic awareness.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>V2I (Vehicle-to-Infrastructure):</strong>Communication with traffic lights and road sensors allows vehicles to anticipate signal changes and adapt speed accordingly.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>V2P (Vehicle-to-Vehicle):</strong> Cars share information about speed, position, and potential hazards to prevent collisions and improve traffic flow.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>V2N (Vehicle-to-Network):</strong> Connection to cloud-based traffic management systems for real-time updates on accidents, road conditions, and optimal routing.
        </ul>
    <p>However, with the geopolitical changes and the shift in operations due to the ongoing conflict, the Yandex Self-Driving Group rebranded and relocated its headquarters to Austin, Texas, becoming Avride. The team now operates outside Russia, though some developments and collaborations continue.</p>

        <h2>Tesla Full Self-Driving (FSD)</h2>
        <p>Tesla's Full Self-Driving (FSD) system is one of the most discussed advancements in the field of autonomous driving. While not at the same level as fully autonomous taxis, Tesla's FSD offers advanced features that significantly improve the driving experience. Here’s an overview of Tesla FSD and how it compares to fully autonomous ride-hailing services:</p>

        <h3>Overview of Tesla FSD</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Technology:</strong> Tesla's FSD system uses a combination of cameras, radar, ultrasonic sensors, and neural networks to provide semi-autonomous driving capabilities. It allows the vehicle to navigate complex urban environments, including city streets, highways, and intersections.</li>
            <li><strong>Autonomy Level:</strong> Tesla's FSD is classified as a Level 3 (L3) autonomous system according to the SAE (Society of Automotive Engineers) standards. This means the vehicle can perform some driving tasks, such as steering, acceleration, and braking, but still requires active supervision by the driver. A human driver must be present and ready to take control at any time, as Tesla vehicles cannot operate fully autonomously.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Comparison to Autonomous Taxis</h3>
        <p>Unlike fully autonomous ride-hailing services, such as those provided by companies like Waymo or Avride, Tesla's FSD is not designed to operate without human intervention. While autonomous taxis (Level 4 or 5) are capable of fully driving themselves within specific geofenced areas or in all environments without any need for human oversight, Tesla's FSD still requires the driver to remain alert and ready to take control at any moment.</p>
    </div>
    <img src="data/tesla-FSD.jpg    " alt="description" class="scale">
    <h5 class="caption">Tesla view of the world.</h5>
    <div class="section">
        <h3>Key Features of Tesla FSD</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Autopilot:</strong> Tesla’s Autopilot system allows for hands-free driving on highways, with the car maintaining speed, lane position, and adjusting to traffic conditions.</li>
            <li><strong>Navigate on Autopilot:</strong> This feature allows the car to automatically navigate highway interchanges, exit ramps, and merge with traffic.</li>
            <li><strong>Summon:</strong> Tesla FSD includes the ability to "summon" the car from a parking space or garage, although this is limited to close distances and requires the driver to remain nearby.</li>
            <li><strong>Autonomous Parking:</strong> Tesla vehicles with FSD can park themselves in both parallel and perpendicular parking spaces.</li>
            <li><strong>Traffic Light and Stop Sign Recognition:</strong> The system can detect traffic lights and stop signs, automatically stopping the car when necessary.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Challenges and Limitations</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Driver Supervision:</strong> Despite its advanced features, Tesla FSD still requires constant driver attention. It is not designed for full autonomy and cannot drive the vehicle without a human being ready to intervene at any time.</li>
            <li><strong>Geographic Limitations:</strong> Tesla FSD operates best in areas with clear road markings and well-defined lane structures. It can struggle in poor weather conditions or areas with inadequate infrastructure.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Future of Tesla FSD</h3>
        <p>Tesla is continuously improving its Full Self-Driving system with over-the-air software updates, adding new features and expanding the system's capabilities. However, Tesla FSD is still far from achieving the full autonomy seen in Level 4 or 5 systems used by autonomous ride-hailing services, like those deployed by companies such as Waymo or Avride.</p>
