<h2>What are Self-Driving Systems?</h2>
<p>
    <b>Autonomous driving</b> is a feature of offered by certain automotive companies like Tesla, Audi, Wayamo etc. <br>
    This feature allows the driver to use autonomous driving/assistance to help drive their vehicles.
    First instance of autonomous assistance was in 1948, where <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ralph_Teetor">Ralph Teetor</a>
    invented the first cruise-control system.<br>
    However, major progress began in the 1980's where, via the funding from both the US government and German government,
    the first semi-autonomous driving system was developed.<br>
    Through later developments in the early 2000's and 2015, the first autonomous driving system was developed.<br>
    From 2017 onwards, companies like Waymo developed privately researched autonomous driving systems.
    And then, further advancements made by Tesla in the 2020's, Full Self Driving (FDS) systems were now capable
    of reliably driving without human input. <br>

            <pre>Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC).
The system controls either
steering or\acceleration/braking

The driver must always keep their

conditions (e.g., in traffic jams).

The driver can completely relax,
but the system is limited to predefined scenarios.

<h2>Pros and Cons</h2>
<h3>Pros</h3>
<p><b>1. Enhanced Safety:</b></p>
<ul>
    <li>Reduced Human Error: Automated Systems reduce human error with driving such as fatigue</li>
    <li>Advanced Senses: Sensors and advance algorithms allow pre-emptive detection of hazardous situations and course correct</li>
</ul>
<p><b>2. Enhanced Convenience</b></p>
<ul>
    <li>Reduces stress while driving, especially in congested areas</li>
    <li>Allows occupants to do other tasks while travelling</li>
</ul>
<p><b>3. Accessibility</b></p>
<ul>
    <li>Allows people who cant drive, for example people with disabilities or elderly people, to drive safely</li>
</ul>
<br>
<hr>
<br>
<h3>Cons</h3>
<p><b>1. Technical difficulties</b></p>
<ul>
    <li>Current FSD systems struggle in complex or unpredictable driving conditions, such as heavy rain, snow, or poorly marked roads.</li>
    <li>Limitations in AIâ€™s ability to handle nuanced human decisions (e.g., ethical dilemmas or interpreting subtle gestures)</li>
</ul>
<p><b>2. Operating Costs</b></p>
<ul>
    <li>Maintenance costs and operating costs are difficult to maintain.</li>
    <li>Costs for AI development and Data centres for AI make it hard to implement FSD systems</li>
</ul>
<p><b>3. Legal Issues and Public trust</b></p>
<ul>
    <li>Many core modules and systems of FSD systems are still debated in courts for their usability.</li>
    <li>Public opinion is still against the idea of having autonomous-driving cars</li>
</ul>
