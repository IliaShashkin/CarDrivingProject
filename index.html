    <h2>What is that</h2>
    <p>
        <b>Autonomous driving</b> is a feature of offered by certain automotive companies like Tesla, Audi, BMW etc. <br>
        This feature allows the driver to use autonomous driving/assistance to help drive their vehicles.
        First instance of autonomous assistance was in 1948, where <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ralph_Teetor">Ralph Teetor</a>
        invented the first cruise-control system.<br>
        However, major progress began in the 1980's where, via the funding from both the US government and German government,
        the first semi-autonomous driving system was developed.<br>
        Through later developments in the early 2000's and 2015, the first autonomous driving system was developed.<br>
        From 2017 onwards, companies like Waymo developed privately researched autonomous driving systems.
        And then, further advancements made by Tesla in the 2020's, Full Self Driving (FDS) systems were now capable
        of reliably driving without human input. <br>
