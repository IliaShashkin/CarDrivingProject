        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) is an advanced driver-assistance system that maintains a safe following distance
            between your vehicle and the one ahead. Unlike traditional cruise control, which maintains a constant speed,
            ACC automatically adjusts your speed based on traffic conditions.

        <h2>Core Components</h2>
        <p>
            The system relies on several key components, including radar sensors, cameras, and onboard computers.
            These sensors detect the speed and distance of vehicles in your lane and calculate adjustments needed
            to maintain a safe gap.

        <h2>How It Works</h2>
        <pre>
1. Detection: The radar or camera detects vehicles in front
of you and measures their speed.
2. Adjustment: The system automatically adjusts your vehicle's
throttle and braking to maintain the preset following distance.
3. Safety Measures: If the vehicle ahead stops suddenly, ACC
alerts the driver and applies emergency braking if necessary.
        </pre>

    <h5 class="caption">The system is actively maintaining a safe distance from the car in front.
        The distance to the car ahead is highlighted on the screen, showing "1.2 seconds," which is a time-based measurement for safe following distance.
        The speed of the car ahead is displayed as "65 km/h," and the current speed of the vehicle is also shown. The warning in red ("Дистанция!" – "Distance!")
        suggests the system is alerting the driver to maintain a safe distance, as the current following distance (1.2 seconds) might be below the recommended safe threshold.</h5>

        <h2>Advantages</h2>
        <p>
            Adaptive Cruise Control enhances driving comfort and safety, especially on highways and in stop-and-go traffic.
            It reduces driver fatigue by managing speed and distance automatically, allowing the driver to focus on steering and navigation.

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Limitations</h2>
        <p>
            While ACC is a useful tool, it has limitations. It may struggle in heavy rain or snow, where sensors can be obstructed.
            Drivers should always remain attentive and ready to take control if needed.
